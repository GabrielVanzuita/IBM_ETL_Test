# 🌍 ETL Project – Country GDP Data, but With Style

## 🧠 Overview
This project is a full ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built to turn raw Country GDP data into clean, structured insights.

We extract a table from the web, enhance it with real-world exchange rates, and load the final product into both a CSV file and a local SQLite database — all while keeping detailed logs of every step.

Originally created as an assigment to the IBM data engeneering course.

## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Packages used:
  - `requests`
  - `pandas`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `lxml`
  - `html5lib`

Install them all with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Make sure `exchange_rates.csv` is present in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the main script to launch the ETL process:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

The output will be stored in `data/output/`, and a SQLite database will be updated or created alongside it.

## 📝 Logging

Every action the pipeline takes — from extraction to transformation to loading — is logged with timestamps. You’ll find those logs in the `logs/` folder, neatly organized by stage.
